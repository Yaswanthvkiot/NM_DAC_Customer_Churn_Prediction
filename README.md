DESIGN THINKING PROCESS 
  Data Collection --> Data Pre-processing --> Model Selection And Training --> Visualization

  The project is developed as 5 phases were all of the documentations were completed and uploaded in this repositary.

  PHASE 1
    In phase 1 the problem statement is defined detailly and the design thinking process is employed.

  PHASE 2
    In phase 2 the design thinking process is ecplained detailly and provided a detailed images visulations of this phase

  PHASE 3
    In phase 3 the dataset is pre-processed and it was ready to make analysis part.

  PHASE 4
    In phase 4 the analysis works were done and the visualization created in the IBM Cognos Platform and two dashboards were implemented.

  PHASE 5
    In phase 5 the overall project is integrated as a single document and submiited in the skillup portal.
